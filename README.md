This program simulates a memory management system using a page/frame table It then translates. Then it initializes a page table mapping logical page numbers to physical frame numbers and handles page faults appropriately. Logical addresses are translated. Users can compile and run the program to observe the translation of sample logical addresses to physical addresses, along with their corresponding page numbers and offsets.
